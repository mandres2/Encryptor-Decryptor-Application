#### What is Decryption?

The process of converting cipher text to plain text is called decryption. It is also coined as decoding


#### What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from the Greek word <i>kryptos</i>, which means hidden. It is closely associated to encryption and decryption.
